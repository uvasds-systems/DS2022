echo "Once upon a $SEASON, there was a $COLOR $ANIMAL who loved to grub on 
food any chance they got, especially $FOOD. The $ANIMAL had a playdate 
planned out with their friends during the $TIME where they were planning 
on $HOBBY. However, the $ANIMAL spotted $FRUIT in the $SWIMMING. They 
ditched their friends, jumped right in, and munched happily ever after."
